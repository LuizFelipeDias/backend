###E-COMMERCE BACKEND

### 1.HOW I DID IT
- I used MySQL and searched the places where I could deploy in a safe way. Firstly to do local I used XAMMP, after that, the api was created and made possible connnect both sides, front an back.
- After that I downloaded the Workbench, worked prety weel. The serves was interconnected.
- To dploy in Web, the KAMATERA and Railway was my choices. Easy to urderstand and cheap. Both of them are secure places to deposity the database.
