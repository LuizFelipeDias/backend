## E-COMMERCE BACKEND

### 1.HOW I DID IT
- I used MySQL and searched the places where I could deploy safely. Firstly, to do local, I used XAMMP, after that, the API was created and made possible to connect both sides, front and back.
- After that, I downloaded the Workbench, which worked pretty well. The serves were interconnected.
- To deploy in Web, the KAMATERA and Railway were my choices. Easy to understand and cheap. Both of them are secure places to deposit the database.
